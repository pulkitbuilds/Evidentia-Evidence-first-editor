        <h3>Why hybrid retrieval?</h3>
        <p>
          Meaning-based search (dense) catches paraphrased claims that don't share exact words with
          the source. Keyword search (sparse/BM25) catches exact names, numbers, and terms that
          embeddings can sometimes blur past. Blending both catches more true matches than either one
          alone.
        </p>
        <h3>Why a database?</h3>
        <p>
          Every source document and every claim you've ever checked is stored permanently (SQLite),
          so your corpus and your case log both survive a server restart — nothing lives only in
          memory.
        </p>
        <h3>What does the Research Assistant actually do?</h3>
        <p>
          It expands your topic into a few different search queries (so it isn't just rephrasing
          the same search), fetches and cleans the resulting web pages, ingests them into the case
          exactly like a manually pasted document, and then drafts a short paragraph using only that
          evidence. The draft is meant as a rough starting point, not a finished answer — dropping it
          into Draft runs it back through the same sentence-by-sentence verification as anything you
          type yourself, so nothing it wrote gets a free pass.
